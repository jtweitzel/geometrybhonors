My 9th grade Geometry B Honors project

For my project, I made a program that can draw polygons. There are two options, 

* Option 1 asks the user to enter a number of sides and the length of the sides.

* Option 2 asks the user to enter coordinates. 

The program is written in Python and uses a module called turtle for drawing.
